<p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Japanese.</br>
  Career objective: I wish to become a programmer with a side job of translating. I previously aspired to become a pediatritian, I still do. However I decided that for my first degree I would pursue something affordable that I do enjoy.
In high school I by chance chose Computer Science instead of Cape Mathematics which had begun my love and appreciation for coding. Ever since the sciences have been the only field I could think to enjoy pursuing. Hence I plan to make something I enjoy my career path.</br>
